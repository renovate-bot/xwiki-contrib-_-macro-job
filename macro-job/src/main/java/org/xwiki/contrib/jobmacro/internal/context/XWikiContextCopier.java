 * Additionally to using {@link XWikiContext#clone()}, this implementation also tries to make sure that the cloned
 * context is usable in a different thread. To do this, the request and the response are stubbed, the URL factory is
 * reinitialized and the store session/transaction are cleared. This latter point is sensible since there is currently
 * no way to clear the session/transaction only in the copied context. So the session/transaction is cleared in the
 * original context before cloning, causing a side effect on the original context. You should never copy a context
 * while a create/update transaction is in progress, since some changes would get rollbacked.
 * <p>
 * Note: The clone is still rather shallow, since many fields will still be shared with the original
 * {@link XWikiContext}.
